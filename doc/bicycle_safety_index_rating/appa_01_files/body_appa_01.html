<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>Bicycle safety index rating</b></font></p>
<b></b> 
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> One of the first modeling attempts 
  was the bicycle safety index rating (BSIR) model developed by Davis.<sup>2</sup> 
  The purpose of the model was to relate bicycle safety to the physical and operational 
  features of the roadway. While no specifics were provided regarding how the 
  association of variables within the model was determined, there was an explanation 
  of why specific variables were included. In determining which of the variables 
  to include in the model and the form that the variable would take in the model, 
  three criteria were established:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 1) The variable must have direct 
  application to the evaluation of mixed vehicle (i.e., motor vehicles and bicycles) 
  operations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 2) The variable must be quantifiable 
  either through a direct measure or an assigned rating.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 3) The variable must be consistent 
  with established data collection practices of local transportation departments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The developed model is made up 
  of two submodels, one for roadway segments and one for intersections (<i>see 
  table 19</i>). The roadway segment submodel is to be used to evaluate uniform 
  segments of roadway between major intersections along a predetermined highway. 
  The intersection submodel is to be used to evaluate the major intersections 
  along this same highway. The overall index for the highway can then be determined 
  by summing all of the individual intersection and roadway segment index values 
  and dividing by the total number of intersections and roadway segments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> This approach produces an average 
  value across the roadway being evaluated and gives equal weighting to roadway 
  segments and intersections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The roadway segment model included 
  variables for traffic volume, speed limit, outside lane width, pavement conditions, 
  and a variety of geometric conditions. Motor vehicle traffic volume was deemed 
  important as it provides some indication of complexity related to the bicyclist: 
  "the more traffic present on the roadway, the more difficulty a bicyclist 
  will have making left turns, watching for opposing movements, and being noticed 
  by motorists." The average annual daily traffic (AADT) volume was selected 
  as the motor vehicle volume to be included in the model, primarily because it 
  is a variable collected by most transportation departments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Combined with AADT in the model 
  is the variable number of travel lanes. The traffic volume per travel lane has 
  been used in previous studies and proved to be a good indicator of interaction 
  conditions for bicyclists with passing motorists.<sup>11</sup> In the model, 
  AADT and number of travel lanes are combined as one of the additive factors 
  as follows:</font></p>
<b>
<p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">AADT/(L*2500)</font></p>
</b>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Thus, any AADT that results in 
  a travel lane volume of more than 2500 vehicles per day (vpd) will create a 
  value greater than 1.0. For example, a two-lane road with an AADT of 7000 would 
  result in a factor of </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="body_appa_01_data/table_19.gif" width="470" height="607"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1.4. In contrast, a roadway segment 
  with a travel lane volume of less than 2500 vpd will result in a value less 
  than 1.0. The speed limit of the roadway was also included in the model for 
  two reasons. First, it was believed that speed limit provided some reasonable 
  indicator of the design speed of the roadway. Second and more importantly, it 
  was believed to provide some indication of travel speeds of motor vehicles, 
  which directly relates to the speed differential between motorists and bicyclists. 
  While these reasons for using speed limit are sound and the need for some measure 
  of motor vehicle speed is needed in the model, the reasoning does not necessarily 
  hold true for all roadways. In a recent Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 
  study, 85th percentile speeds on a variety of rural and urban, two-lane and 
  multilane roadways was found to be from 6 to 14 mi/h over the posted speed limit.<sup>12</sup> 
  This is not surprising considering the number of factors that are often considered 
  when a speed limit is set. Another recent study found that while the 85th percentile 
  speed is often used as the principal criterion,<i> </i>engineering judgment 
  and the consideration of other factors often results in the establishment of 
  arbitrary speed limits that do not reflect travel speeds.<sup>13</sup> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The additive factor containing 
  the speed limit variable within the model was written as follows:</font></p>
<b>
<p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">S/35</font></p>
</b>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> From previous research, it had 
  been shown that speed differentials between motorists and bicyclists remain 
  fairly constant (between 10 and 15 mi/h) up to motor vehicle speeds of approximately 
  35 mi/h.<sup>14</sup> In another study, it was shown that more than 50 percent 
  of all bicycle fatalities occurred on roadways with posted speed limits greater 
  than 35 mi/h.<sup>15</sup> Thus, 35 mi/h was selected as the denominator in 
  the speed limit factor within the model. Any roadways with a speed limit of 
  35 would produce a factor of 1.0; speed limits of 30 and lower would produce 
  factors less than 1.0 and posted speed limits of 40 and higher would produce 
  factors greater than 1.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The outside or curb lane width 
  was the next variable included in the model. This variable was included since 
  it determines the travel space available for bicycling within the roadway and 
  the space available for an overtaking motorist who desires to remain in the 
  curb lane during the maneuver. Curb lane widths of 14 ft were cited from two 
  sources as being the desirable width to provide safe bicycling conditions.<sup>16,17</sup> 
  The variable is presented in the model as follows:</font></p>
<b>
<p align="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(14-W)/2</font></p>
</b>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As noted in the variable definitions 
  presented with the model above, any lane width greater than 14 ft will still 
  use a value of 14 ft within the model, i.e., 14 ft is the maximum value that 
  can be used in the model. Based on this definition, any lane width greater than 
  or equal to 14 ft will produce a factor of zero. One problem with this restriction 
  is that no benefit is gained from curb lane widths of 15 ft or greater. If larger 
  values were used, a negative value would be produced, which would reduce the 
  index value. Lane widths less than 14 ft will produce positive values that will 
  add to the index. For example, a lane width of 12 ft would produce a positive 
  factor of 1.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Pavement condition was the next 
  variable included in the model. This variable was included because defects or 
  irregularities in the paved surface can affect the comfort and safety of bicyclists. 
  As noted in the variable definitions presented with the model above, eight different 
  conditions are provided to define detrimental pavement surfaces. Each of these 
  conditions has a value assigned to it. An explanation of how these values were 
  derived was not provided. An examination of the values, however, does seem to 
  indicate that some degree of relative importance was assigned within the factor 
  itself. For example, potholes, rough edges, and drainage grates are perhaps 
  the most dangerous to bicyclists and, thus, were assigned the largest value 
  (0.75). Patching, weathering, and curb and gutter on the other hand, are not 
  nearly as problematic for bicyclists and were assigned a value of 0.25. The 
  other conditions (rough railroad crossings and cracking) were considered to 
  fall in between the two extremes and were assigned a value of 0.50. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The last factor in the model is 
  the location factor, which incorporates a variety of measures related to both 
  geometrics and operations along a roadway segment. Those for bicyclists were 
  assigned a positive value while those conditions which potentially improve bicycle 
  safety were assigned a negative value. For example, parking along the roadside, 
  grades, restricted sight distances, and driveways all received positive values. 
  Paved shoulders and physical medians received negative values. As with the pavement 
  factor, no detailed explanation was given regarding how these assigned values 
  were derived, but there does seem to be relative importance among the operational 
  and geometric conditions present within the factor. The condition perceived 
  to be the most beneficial was the presence of a paved shoulder, with a value 
  of -0.75, while the condition perceived to create the greatest safety hazard 
  was angle parking, with a value of 0.75. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> As with the roadway segment model, 
  traffic volume was deemed important at the intersection because it provides 
  some indication of the level of complexity. The first factor is intended to 
  simply provide a number relative to the total entering volume at a given intersection. 
  If this volume is greater than 10,000 vpd, the factor will be greater than 1.0, 
  indicating a more difficult intersection for the bicyclist. The second volume-related 
  factor is intended to provide some indication of the level of difficulty that 
  would be experienced by a bicyclist on a low-volume street crossing a high-volume 
  street or vice versa. As an example, assume a bicyclist on a street with an 
  entering volume of 20,000 vpd is crossing a street with an entering volume of 
  5,000 vpd. The factor for these conditions becomes 1.6. If the bicyclist is 
  on the low-volume roadway and is crossing the high-volume street, the factor 
  becomes 0.4. Intuitively, this factor appears to provide an opposite result 
  of what is expected; in most cases, exclusive of signalization and geometrics, 
  one would hypothesize that it would be more difficult for the bicyclist to cross 
  the high-volume roadway than the low-volume roadway. Again, there is no explanation 
  regarding the development of these factors. Thus, a full understanding of what 
  the author intended the factor to represent is difficult.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The geometrics variable is the 
  next factor included in the model. This variable was intended to quantify the 
  traffic maneuver complexity of the intersection. The number of lanes and type 
  of lane are the predominant variables included in this factor, with a right-turn 
  lane being given the highest value of 0.75. This probably reflects the fact 
  that the provision of such a lane for motor vehicles produces a weaving situation 
  for motorists turning right and bicyclists proceeding through the intersection. 
  Restricted sight distance and substandard curb radii are also geometric variables 
  that should be considered as part of the factor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The last factor in the intersection 
  model is the signalization factor. These factors are intended to indicate how 
  signal operations at a specific intersection may impact upon the safety of the 
  bicyclists. If a signal is actuated, it is considered to have a negative impact 
  on bicycling safety resulting from the fact that bicyclists often cannot be 
  detected by the detection loops.<sup>18</sup> This fact, in turn, can result 
  in the bicyclist crossing against the light and putting him or herself in a 
  dangerous situation. If the clearance interval is sub-standard, i.e., not long 
  enough for bicyclists, a value of 0.75 is used. A value of less than 4.0 s is 
  considered substandard in the model. Finally, if permissive left turns are allowed 
  or if right-turn arrows are present, conditions are present that may require 
  motorists to yield to bicyclists, which may create a hazardous situation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A case study using the developed 
  models was conducted in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A total of seven roadways consisting 
  of 21 uniform segments and 29 major intersections were included in the study. 
  The appropriate indexes were computed for each segment and intersection and 
  then combined to form the overall index rating (BSIR) for each roadway. The 
  ratings produced for the seven roadways ranged from 4.46 to 6.54. Relative comparisons 
  were made between each individual rating and the other six ratings. On the basis 
  of the author’s knowledge of the roadways selected and the ratings produced 
  from the models, a classification scheme was developed to define bicycle operation 
  based on the BSIR values (<i>see table 20</i>). Of the seven roadways included 
  in the case study, two were classified as "good," three were classified 
  as "fair," and two were classified as "poor."</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As noted by the author, these indexes 
  are not definitive values, but instead assign general designations to roadways 
  that can be used in determining bicycle routes, preparing bicycle maps, or prioritizing 
  improvements for bicycling. While this study provides a good starting point 
  for examining specific variables that may be important to bicycle operations, 
  it was not able to conclusively define how important specific variables were 
  to either bicycle safety or operations. First, there was no bicycle accident 
  analysis conducted on any of the segments included in the case study. Thus, 
  the term bicycle "safety" index rating is misleading. While there 
  is no argument that many of the factors included may impact upon the safety 
  of bicyclists operating concurrently with motor vehicles, the validation of 
  how these factors actually impact upon safety was not performed. Second, the 
  classification scheme developed was based entirely on the relative differences 
  in the indexes produced and the author’s knowledge of the routes. This method 
  of developing a classification scheme is problematic from the standpoint that: 
  1) it relies on the subjective judgment of the author to establish the scale 
  of what is considered excellent, good, fair, or poor; and 2) the classification 
  scheme may not be transferable to other cities or even other locations within 
  the city since the relative differences between the sites used played a large 
  part in establishing the scheme.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally, there is the problem of 
  combining the results from the two submodels into a single rating. Since the 
  final result was simply an average of all intersection and segment values produced 
  for the roadway, it was assumed that roadway segments are equivalent to intersections 
  in terms of safety or operational difficulty for the bicyclist. Recent work 
  has shown that 50.4 percent of all bicycle accidents occur at intersections 
  or are intersection related.<sup>19</sup> An additional 21.4 percent of the 
  bicycle accidents occur at other types of junctions, such as driveways. These 
  results indicate a need to perhaps weight intersections significantly more when 
  combining results. It is also possible that the two scenarios, intersections 
  and segments, cannot be combined; they are simply too different in terms of 
  the maneuvers required, the type and number of conflicts encountered, and the 
  overall geometric and operational conditions.</font> </p>
