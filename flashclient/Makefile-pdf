# You can run mxmlc yourself and interact directly with the flex compiler,
# but fcsh-wrap abstracts that for us, since we generally need to preprocess
# our source files with m4.
#
# However, [lb] has problems with compilation generally failing the first
# time after make clean, and sometimes endlessly failing after lots of
# successful intermittent make.
#
# DEVS: You might want to consider using Makefile-new:
#       See the Bash command, `remake`, in .bashrc-cyclopath;
#       if you have make fails, run remake, which will eventually
#       produce a SWF.
