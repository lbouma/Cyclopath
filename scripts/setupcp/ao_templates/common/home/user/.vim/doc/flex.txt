Adobe Flex is a highly productive, free open source framework for building
and maintaining expressive web applications that deploy consistently on all
major browsers, desktops, and operating systems.  Flex applications can be
built using the free Flex SDK
(http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex3sdk).

This document outlines the various features the Vim Flex Development Support
suite provides and how to interact with it to enhance the Vim development
experience for Flex applications.

==============================================================================
1. Overview					*flex-overview*

Adobe Flex consists of two types of files:
    MXML (*.mxml) files
    Actionscript (*.as) files 

MXML is a XML-based user interface markup language first introduced by
Macromedia in March 2004. Adobe Systems (which acquired Macromedia in
December 2005) gives no official meaning for the acronym, but some
developers suggest it should stand for "Magic eXtensible Markup Language"
(which is a backronym). It's likely that the name comes from the MX suffix
given to Macromedia Studio products released in 2002 and 2004. Application
developers use MXML in combination with ActionScript to develop Rich
Internet applications, with products such as Adobe Flex.

ActionScript is a scripting language based on ECMAScript (similar to
Javascript). ActionScript is used primarily for the development of websites
and software using the Adobe Flash Player platform (in the form of SWF files
embedded into Web pages), but is also used in some database applications
(such as Alpha Five), and in basic robotics, as with the Make Controller
Kit. Originally developed by Macromedia, the language is now owned by Adobe
(which acquired Macromedia in 2005). ActionScript was initially designed for
controlling simple 2D vector animations made in Adobe Flash (formerly
Macromedia Flash). Later versions added functionality allowing for the
creation of Web-based games and rich Internet applications with streaming
media (such as video and audio).

Vim includes features for:
    Indentation 
    Syntax highlighting
    MXML code completion
    Compiling


==============================================================================
2. Flex FileTypes				*flex-ft*
-----------------				*flex-ftplugin*

The Flex suite contains numerous files to add support for Flex: >
    ftplugin\mxml.vim
    ftplugin\actionscript.vim

    indent\actionscript.vim
    indent\mxml.vim

    syntax\actionscript.vim
    syntax\mxml.vim

    compiler\mxmlc.vim

    autoload\mxmlcomplete.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml32.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_display.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_errors.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_events.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_filters.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_geom.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_media.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_mx.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_net.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_printing.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_system.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_text.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_ui.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_utils.vim
        autoload\xml\mxml_xml.vim

To automatically enable the ftplugins for mxml and actionscript you can
edit your: >
    vimfiles/filetype.vim
    .vim/filetype.vim
<
Make sure the following entries are defined: >
    " Flex Development
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.mxml    		setfiletype mxml
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.as          	setfiletype actionscript

Also make sure you have the following line in your |vimrc| >
    filetype on
<

==============================================================================
3. Navigation					*flex-navigation*

The Flex ftplugins (MXML and ActionScript) provides a number of options to
assist with file navigation.


3.1 Matchit					*flex-matchit*
-----------
The matchit plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39)
provides many additional features and can be customized for different
languages.  The matchit plugin is configured by defining a local
buffer variable, b:match_words.  Pressing the % key while on various
keywords will move the cursor to its match.  For example, if the cursor is on
an "if", pressing % will cycle between the "else if" and "else" keywords.

The following keywords are supported: >
    if
    else if 
    else

    while
	break
	continue

    for
	break
	continue

    do
	statements
    while

    switch
        case
            break
        case
        default

    try
        catch
        finally



3.2 Text Object Motions				*flex-object-motions*
-----------------------
Vim has a number of predefined keys for working with text |object-motions|.
This filetype plugin attempts to translate these keys to maps which make sense
for the flex language.

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps exist: >
    ]]		    move forward to the next '}'
    [[		    move backwards to the previous '}'
    ][		    move forward to the next '{'
    []		    move backwards to the previous '{'



3.3 Macros					   *flex-macros*
----------
Vim's feature to find macro definitions, |'var'|, is supported using this
regular expression: >
    \<var\>

This addresses the following code: >
    var myArray:Array = new Array();
    private var callback:Function;

Place your cursor on "myArray" on this line: >
	 for each (elem:int in myArray) 
		                ^
         {
         }

Press any of the following keys: >
    [d
    [D
    [CTRL-D

And you the var myArray line will be displayed in a few formats.


3.4 Imports					*flex-import*
-----------
ActionScript can be embedded within <mx:Script> tags within MXML or you can
create ActionScript only files (myfile.as).  Imports are like all other
languages.  If we assume a standard project directory layout: >
    +--C:\project
        +--bin-debug
        ¦  +--assets
        ¦  +--flexlib
        ¦  +--history
        +--html-template
        ¦  +--history
        +--libs
        ¦  +--flexlib.swc
        +--src
        ¦  +--com
        ¦     +--myCompany
        ¦        +--myProject
        ¦           +--Common.as
        ¦  +--main.mxml

If we have a main.mxml that looks like this: >
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" >
	<mx:Script>
            <![CDATA[
                import com.myCompany.myProject.Common;
		]]>
	</mx:Script>
    </mx:Application>

While editing this file you may want to begin editing Common.as.
The Flex script has gear to allow you to use |gf| to "goto file".
This Vim feature requires that certain directories are already in 
the |path| if the file is not present in the current directory.

Setting the |path| can be easily accomplished using autocmds and 
utilizing one of the functions within the mxml and actionscript 
ftplugins. >
    augroup myProject
        au!
        autocmd bufread */project/* 
                    \ let root_dir = substitute(fnamemodify(expand("<afile>"), ':p:h'), 'project\zs.*', '', '') |
                    \ if exists("*AddSearchPath_".&ft) | 
                    \     call AddSearchPath_{&ft}(root_dir.'/src') | 
                    \ endif
    augroup end

Breaking down the autocmd:
    For any file opened under the myProject (C:\project\src): >
        autocmd bufread */project/* 
<
    Get the directory of the file just opened: >
                    \ let root_dir = substitute(fnamemodify(expand("<afile>"), ':p:h'), 'project\zs.*', '', '') |
<
    &ft = filetype, this will be either mxml or actionscript.  If the
    ftplugin successfully created the required function, call it passing
    in "C:\project\src".  The autocmd is used with fnamemodify so that this 
    code will work for any project.  If the project changes drive locations 
    your Vim configuration stays the same. >
                    \ if exists("*AddSearchPath_".&ft) | 
                    \     call AddSearchPath_{&ft}(root_dir.'/src') | 
                    \ endif

Once these items have been added to the |path| placing your cursor anywhere on
this line: >
    import com.myCompany.myProject.Common;
                    ^
<
If you press 'gf' Vim will correctly find the file and open it for editing.


==============================================================================
4. OMNI MXML Completion				*flex-completion*
----------------------- 			*omni-flex-completion*
                        			*mxml-completion*

Vim 7 includes a code completion interface |compl-omni| and functions which
allows plugin developers to build in code completion for any language.  
The MXML completion takes advantage of |ft-xml-omni| and provides the
necessary data files to allow it to complete MXML tags.

If you are familiar with HTML and OMNI then you will be right at home with
MXML completion.  Tags have been generated based on Flex 3.  The XML
namespaces exist in $VIMRUNTIME/autoload/xml/mxml_*.vim.

See the |mxml-completion-tutorial| for examples.

If someone knows how to generate a list of classes and the associated methods
for ActionScript, please let me know.  I will add code completion for it in
addition to the MXML code completion.

==============================================================================
5. Flex Compilation				*flex-compile*

There are two different ways of compiling a Flex application.
    1.  mxmlc (command line compiler)
    2.  Ant

5.1 mxmlc
---------
The flex command line compiler (mxmlc) is included with the Flex SDK.

A Vim mxml compiler plugin (compiler/mxmlc.vim) has been created to assist
with compiling your files.  Configuration of the command line is best done via
autocmds based on your project.  See the |flex-compiler-tutorial| for
examples.

The compiler accepts a number of different (mostly) buffer local variables. >
    g:mxmclPath
<       This is the only global option.  It allows you to specify
        the location of mxmlc binary.  If not specified, it assumes
        mxmlc is already in the path. >
    b:mxmlcOptions
<       Allows you to specify any additional command line options. >
    b:mxmlcDebug
<       Whether this should be a debug build of not. >
    b:mxmlcIncludeLibs
<       If your project relies on any additional libraries, these can
        be listed.  This can be a comma separate list of SWC files. >
    b:mxmlcOutputDir
<       The location to generate the resulting SWF file.


5.2 Ant
-------

There are lots of docs on the web on how to create an ANT build file for 
your Flex project.  To build with ANT from Vim, the ant_menu plugin 
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=155) is very useful.



==============================================================================
6. Indenting                			*flex-indenting*

Vim includes many commands (based on filetype) to indent or re-indent
text, see |indent.txt|.

There are two components of a Flex application.  The MXML files and
Actionscript files.  Actionscript is very similar to Javascript.  These
files can be in a separate file (myClass.as) or embedded within mx:Script
tags:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" 
            layout="absolute"
            width="1100" height="800"
            >
            <mx:Script>
                <![CDATA[
                import flash.events.Event;
                [Bindable] private var _serverHostPort:String = "";
                private var cmdlineHostAddress:String;

                public function myFunc():void 
                {
                }
                ]]>
            </mx:Script>
<
    </mx:Application>

The files can be indented like any other file using Vim's standard features.
You can visually highlight a section of code and hit |=|.  You can reformat
the entire file using gg=G.

Unfortunately, due to a limitation of the cindent() function, when
actionscript is embedded within a MXML file, the code will be indented to
the far left of the file.  So indenting of the above code will look like:
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml" 
            layout="absolute"
            width="1100" height="800">
            <mx:Script>
    <![CDATA[
    import flash.events.Event;
    [Bindable] private var _serverHostPort:String = "";
    private var cmdlineHostAddress:String;

    public function myFunc():void 
    {
    }
    ]]>
            </mx:Script>
    </mx:Application>

You can easily shift the code back by visually selecting the text between 
the <mx:Script> tags and using the >> operator.


==============================================================================
7. Syntax Highlighting                		*flex-syntax*
----------------------                          *mxml-syntax*
                                                *actionscript-syntax*

Included are syntax/mxml.vim and syntax/actionscript.vim.
See |flex-ftplugin| to ensure Vim automatically enables syntax highlighting.


==============================================================================
8. Flex Tutorial				*flex-tutorial*
-----------------				*mxml-tutorial*
                 				*actionscript-tutorial*

This tutorial is designed to take you through the features available
when using Vim with Flex projects.

First, create a new buffer: >
     :e tutorial.mxml
<
8.1 Code Completion    				*flex-completion-tutorial*
-------------------     			*omni-flex-completion-tutorial*
						*mxml-completion-tutorial*

If someone knows how to generate a list of classes and the associated methods
for ActionScript, please let me know.  I will add code completion for it in
addition to the MXML code completion.

If someone knows how to generate a list of classes and the associated methods
for ActionScript, please let me know.  I will add code completion for it in
addition to the MXML code completion.
Assuming you have already read |flex-completion|, add the following to the
buffer: >
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
        <
    </mx:Application>
<
Place your cursor on the blank line between the mx:Application tags.  Insert
a < and trigger OMNI completion (<CTRL-X><CTRL-O> |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|).  All
tags for all available namespaces are displayed.

Hit escape to abort the completion (and hit u (undo) if something was added).  
Type mx:H and hit <CTRL-X><CTRL-O> again.  The list will be reduced to two
items.  To reduce the items in the list to a given namespace, you can first
type <mx before hitting <CTRL-X><CTRL-O>.

Choose the mx:HTTPService tag.
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
        <mx:HTTPService
    </mx:Application>

Another alternative is to type <HTT<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>.  This will limit
the choices to any namespace but beginning with "HTT".

After choosing the mx:HTTPService tag add a space (after it) and press
<CTRL-X><CTRL-O> again.  This will bring up a list of available
attributes for the tag.  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
        <mx:HTTPService id="" />
    </mx:Application>

This time add the DataGrid tag as follows:
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
        <mx:HTTPService id="" />
        <mx:DataGrid>

    </mx:Application>

For the next tag on the blank line begin typing the closing tag "</"
followed by <CTRL-X><CTRL-O>.  When leading with the </ and triggering
completion this instructs the completion to close the last open tag.
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <mx:Application xmlns:mx="http://www.adobe.com/2006/mxml">
        <mx:HTTPService id="" />
        <mx:DataGrid>
        </mx:DataGrid>
    </mx:Application>


8.2 Imports       				*flex-imports-tutorial*
-----------

Setting up a tutorial for using "gf" with imports requires creating multiple 
files.  Please read the |flex-import| section.  Create the required autocmds
in your |.vimrc| and then try out the "gf" with your import statements.


8.3 Compiling    				*flex-compiler-tutorial*
-------------                   		*flex-compiling-tutorial*

Assuming you have read |flex-compile| lets start by compiling with the
mxmlc compiler.

8.3.1 mxmlc
-----------

Since you compile main.mxml and not the other files in your project, create
an autocmd which is keyed off of this file: >
    autocmd! BufRead main.mxml 
            \ let b:mxmlcOutputDir=fnamemodify(fnamemodify(expand("<afile>"), ':p:h').'\..\bin-debug', ':p')|
            \ let b:mxmlcIncludeLibs=fnamemodify(fnamemodify(expand("<afile>"), ':p:h').'\..\libs\flexlib.swc', ':p')|
            \ let b:mxmlcDebug=1
<
The use of the fnamemodify and expand allow the command line to generate
absolute file names by specifying relative paths to the location of
main.mxml.  This approach is not necessary, but when you copy and paste this to
different projects, the advantage is you do not have to tweak the paths over
and over again which makes long term maintenance easier.

Assuming you are using the standard FlexBuilder project directory structure: >
    +--C:\project
        +--bin-debug
        ¦  +--assets
        ¦  +--flexlib
        ¦  +--history
        +--html-template
        ¦  +--history
        +--libs
        ¦  +--flexlib.swc
        +--src
        ¦  +--main.mxml
<
Then with the autocmd defined and you run: >
    :compiler mxmlc
<
The following compiler command will be generated and it will also be
displayed to the screen so you can verify: >
    mxmlc -compiler.debug 
          -compiler.include-libraries C:\project\libs\flexlib.swc 
          -output C:\project\bin-debug\main.swf
          C:\project\src\main.mxml
<
Next simply run the following Vim commands to compiler and see any messages
generated from the compiler: >
    :make
    :copen
<

8.3.2 Ant
---------
This section assumes you have installed the ant_menu plugin 
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=155).
If you are using the standard FlexBuilder project directory structure: >
    +--C:\project
        +--bin-debug
        ¦  +--assets
        ¦  +--flexlib
        ¦  +--history
        +--html-template
        ¦  +--history
        +--libs
        ¦  +--flexlib.swc
        +--src
        ¦  +--main.mxml
        +--build.xml
<
You can create the flex ant build file here: C:\project\build.xml.
Next, create an autocmd to automatically set the location of the build.xml
file for the ant_menu plugin. >
    augroup myProject
        au!
        autocmd bufread */project/*
                \ let buildFile = substitute(fnamemodify(expand("<afile>"), ':p:h'), 'project\zs.*', '', '')|
                \ let g:AM_userBuildFile = buildFile.'\build.xml'
    augroup end
<
For a description of how and why we are using the fnamemodify and expand
functions, see the |flex-import| and |flex-compiler-tutorial| sections.

With the augroup / autocmd created, from within Vim you can use Vim's menu and
select Plugin -> ANT -> Build.  The output can be viewed in the usual Vim way
using |:copen|.
