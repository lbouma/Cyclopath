# PostgreSQL configuration file
# -----------------------------
#
# This file consists of lines of the form:
#
#   name = value
#
# (The "=" is optional.)  Whitespace may be used.  Comments are introduced with
# "#" anywhere on a line.  The complete list of parameter names and allowed
# values can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation.
#
# The commented-out settings shown in this file represent the default values.
# Re-commenting a setting is NOT sufficient to revert it to the default value;
# you need to reload the server.
#
# This file is read on server startup and when the server receives a SIGHUP
# signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have to SIGHUP the
# server for the changes to take effect, or use "pg_ctl reload".  Some
# parameters, which are marked below, require a server shutdown and restart to
# take effect.
#
# Any parameter can also be given as a command-line option to the server, e.g.,
# "postgres -c log_connections=on".  Some parameters can be changed at run time
# with the "SET" SQL command.
#
# Memory units:  kB = kilobytes        Time units:  ms  = milliseconds

# [Cyclopath] 
# As a Cyclopath developer, I [lb] often run with "log_statement = 'all'",
# which makes for very large logfiles, but I don't need to keep the logfiles
# longer than the debugging session (i.e., longer than a day). But I also like
# to tail my logfiles and have an aliased command setup to do so, so I need the
# logfile name(s) to be predictable. Given these requirements, and considering
# how log naming and rotation works in postgresql, the best solution is to use
# log rotation (so old logfiles get deleted and don't waste disk space) and to
# use a predicatable naming scheme, such as using the name of the weekday in
# the logfile name (then there are just seven predetermined logfile names that
# the 'tail' command needs to know about).
